# Security Policy

## Reporting

Do not open public issues for security reports. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting on this repository and include impact, reproduction steps, and any suggested mitigation.

## Current Security Model

- The public MCP deployment serves demo data only.
- Private deployments should set `MEDLOCK_MCP_TOKEN` before connecting real Solid Pod data.
- The MCP endpoint validates allowed hosts and origins.
- Tool results are read-only and avoid server-triggered camera access.
- The waitlist stores production contact records in Firestore through the Bun API when `WAITLIST_BACKEND=firestore`.
- Pull request previews set `WAITLIST_BACKEND=memory`, so preview signups are ephemeral and do not write to production Firestore.
- Error responses do not include stack traces.
